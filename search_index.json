GraphQL is a specification for how to talk to an API. This part also covers GraphQL vs REST with an example and takes you over benefits of GraphQL\"\n---\n\n## What is GraphQL?\nGraphQL is a specification for how to talk to an API. It's typically used over HTTP where the key idea is to `POST` a \"query\" to an HTTP endpoint, instead of hitting different HTTP endpoints for different resources.\n\nGraphQL is designed for developers of web/mobile apps (HTTP clients) to be able to make API calls to fetch the data they need from their backend APIs conveniently.\n\n## GraphQL vs REST: an example\nLet's say you have an API to fetch a user's profile and their address. In a typical REST scenario, this is what the request/response would look like:\n\n![GraphQL API example](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/rest-api.png)\n\nIf your API server was a GraphQL server instead, this is what your API calls would look like:\n\n![GraphQL API example](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/graphql-api.gif)\n\nYou can see that the response JSON is different for different \"queries\" sent by the client.\n\n```\nRequest1:         |  Response1:\n\nquery {           |  {\n  user (id: 1) {  |    \"user\": {\n    id            |       \"id\": 1\n  }               |     }\n}                 |  }\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nRequest2:         |   Response2:\n\nquery {           |   {\n  user (id: 1) {  |     \"user\": {\n    id            |       \"id\": 1\n    name          |       \"name\": \"Elmo\"\n  }               |     }\n}                 |   }\n```\n\n## Thinking in GraphQL\n\nWe're changing the way we think about API calls. Instead of making different API\ncalls to different URLs to fetch data, we're making ad-hoc queries to a \"single\nURL endpoint\" that returns data based on the query.\n- Instead of 'GET'ing a resource you 'POST' a query that describes what data you\n  want.\n- You think of the data your API returns as a \"graph\", this allows you to make\n  queries to fetch \"related\" pieces of data in a single shot. In the example\n  above, you fetch the user and the user's address (as a nested JSON object)\n  in the same API call, as opposed to making 2 API calls.\n- The \"query\" you send as data in the POST request has a structure and a syntax.\n  This \"language\" is called GraphQL.\n\nAs you can see in the example above, GraphQL queries look very neat and easy to\nread! This is because the query is the \"shape\" of the final JSON data you desire.\nThis is one of the key-reasons that makes GraphQL a joy to work with!\n\n## GraphQL benefits\n\n- **Avoid over-fetching**: You avoid fetching more data than you need because you\n  can specify the exact **fields** you need.\n- **Prevent multiple API calls**: In case you need more data, you can also avoid\n  making multiple calls to your API. In the case above, you don't need to make\n  2 API calls to fetch `user` and `address` separately.\n- **Lesser communication with API developers**: Sometimes to fetch the exact data\n  you need, especially if you need to fetch more data and want to avoid multiple API\n  calls, you will need to ask your API developers to build a new API. With GraphQL,\n  your work is *independent* of the API team!

GraphQL is a specification for how to talk to an API. This part also covers GraphQL vs REST with an example and takes you over benefits of GraphQL\"\n---\n\n## What is GraphQL?\nGraphQL is a specification for how to talk to an API. It's typically used over HTTP where the key idea is to `POST` a \"query\" to an HTTP endpoint, instead of hitting different HTTP endpoints for different resources.\n\nGraphQL is designed for developers of web/mobile apps (HTTP clients) to be able to make API calls to fetch the data they need from their backend APIs conveniently.\n\n## GraphQL vs REST: an example\nLet's say you have an API to fetch a user's profile and their address. In a typical REST scenario, this is what the request/response would look like:\n\n![GraphQL API example](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/rest-api.png)\n\nIf your API server was a GraphQL server instead, this is what your API calls would look like:\n\n![GraphQL API example](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/graphql-api.gif)\n\nYou can see that the response JSON is different for different \"queries\" sent by the client.\n\n```\nRequest1:         |  Response1:\n\nquery {           |  {\n  user (id: 1) {  |    \"user\": {\n    id            |       \"id\": 1\n  }               |     }\n}                 |  }\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nRequest2:         |   Response2:\n\nquery {           |   {\n  user (id: 1) {  |     \"user\": {\n    id            |       \"id\": 1\n    name          |       \"name\": \"Elmo\"\n  }               |     }\n}                 |   }\n```\n\n## Thinking in GraphQL\n\nWe're changing the way we think about API calls. Instead of making different API\ncalls to different URLs to fetch data, we're making ad-hoc queries to a \"single\nURL endpoint\" that returns data based on the query.\n- Instead of 'GET'ing a resource you 'POST' a query that describes what data you\n  want.\n- You think of the data your API returns as a \"graph\", this allows you to make\n  queries to fetch \"related\" pieces of data in a single shot. In the example\n  above, you fetch the user and the user's address (as a nested JSON object)\n  in the same API call, as opposed to making 2 API calls.\n- The \"query\" you send as data in the POST request has a structure and a syntax.\n  This \"language\" is called GraphQL.\n\nAs you can see in the example above, GraphQL queries look very neat and easy to\nread! This is because the query is the \"shape\" of the final JSON data you desire.\nThis is one of the key-reasons that makes GraphQL a joy to work with!\n\n## GraphQL benefits\n\n- **Avoid over-fetching**: You avoid fetching more data than you need because you\n  can specify the exact **fields** you need.\n- **Prevent multiple API calls**: In case you need more data, you can also avoid\n  making multiple calls to your API. In the case above, you don't need to make\n  2 API calls to fetch `user` and `address` separately.\n- **Lesser communication with API developers**: Sometimes to fetch the exact data\n  you need, especially if you need to fetch more data and want to avoid multiple API\n  calls, you will need to ask your API developers to build a new API. With GraphQL,\n  your work is *independent* of the API team! This allows you to work faster on your\n  app.\n- **Self-documenting**: Every GraphQL API conforms to a \"schema\" which is the graph\n  data model and what kinds of queries a client can make. This allows the community\n  to build lots of cool tools to explore & visualise your API or create IDE plugins\n  that autocomplete your GraphQL queries and even do \"codegen\". We'll understand this\n  in more detail later!\n\nHere's a quick chart to show you the GraphQL analogs of typical REST-ish terms:\n\n| Requirement | REST | GraphQL |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Fetching data objects | GET | query |\n| Writing data | POST | mutation |\n| Updating/deleting data | PUT/PATCH/DELETE | mutation |\n| Watching/subscribing to data | - | subscription |\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/matsuzakiyoshinori/go/src/github.com/yellow-high5/naked_doc/content/intro-to-graphql.md","fields":{"slug":"/intro-to-graphql","id":"86a83c00-7caa-5ce3-9530-204cf8200e63","title":"Intro to GraphQL"}}},"c82be17c-b7df-5def-838d-57d8fffe8260":{"slug":"/introduction","title":"Course Introduction","description":"A powerful and concise tutorial that will introduce you to GraphQL and integrating GraphQL into your React app with Apollo, in the shortest amount of time possible.","node":{"id":"c82be17c-b7df-5def-838d-57d8fffe8260","children":[],"parent":"870c0942-3d2d-560c-bf3e-6a06fd41b8b9","internal":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Course Introduction\"\nmetaTitle: \"Course Introduction | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"A powerful and concise tutorial that will introduce you to GraphQL and integrating GraphQL into your React app with Apollo, in the shortest amount of time possible.\"\n---\n\nGraphQL is becoming the new way to use APIs in modern web and mobile apps.\n\nHowever, learning new things always takes time and without getting your hands dirty it’s very hard to understand the nuances of a new technology.\n\nSo, we put together a powerful and concise course that will introduce you to GraphQL and integrating GraphQL into your frontend stack, in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nWe will explore the fundamentals of GraphQL and the things that make GraphQL especially suitable for modern applications, like its realtime capabilities!

We are wrapping all of this in a function which will return the client.\n\nWe are going to make use of this function inside `App` component.\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/matsuzakiyoshinori/go/src/github.com/yellow-high5/naked_doc/content/apollo-client.md","fields":{"slug":"/apollo-client","id":"84e2da56-17b6-5fe4-9813-84988b0c6459","title":"Set up a GraphQL client with Apollo"}}},"8686a9a2-b50e-58d9-9a02-54211d3e389f":{"slug":"/mutations-variables","title":"Mutations & Query variables","description":"Integrate GraphQL Mutations to create new personal todos using the useMutation React hook and handle loading and error states","node":{"id":"8686a9a2-b50e-58d9-9a02-54211d3e389f","children":[],"parent":"48145ddc-ee6b-5197-840a-14e45861bae2","internal":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Mutations & Query variables\"\nmetaTitle: \"Integrate Mutations with Query Variables | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"Integrate GraphQL Mutations to create new personal todos using the useMutation React hook and handle loading and error states\"\n---\n\nNow, let's add the ability for our users to create new todos and add them to\ntheir task list.\n\nWe will learn the following concepts:\n\n- Creating a GraphQL mutation\n- Using the `useMutation` React hook\n- Capturing loading/finished/error states\n\nLet's get started!\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"821de2992d139c72d613cb5fceee7629","counter":85,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mutations & Query variables","metaTitle":"Integrate Mutations with Query Variables | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"Integrate GraphQL Mutations to create new personal todos using the useMutation React hook and handle loading and error states"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Mutations & Query variables\"\nmetaTitle: \"Integrate Mutations with Query Variables | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"Integrate GraphQL Mutations to create new personal todos using the useMutation React hook and handle loading and error states\"\n---\n\nNow, let's add the ability for our users to create new todos and add them to\ntheir task list.\n\nWe will learn the following concepts:\n\n- Creating a GraphQL mutation\n- Using the `useMutation` React hook\n- Capturing loading/finished/error states\n\nLet's get started!\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/matsuzakiyoshinori/go/src/github.com/yellow-high5/naked_doc/content/mutations-variables.md","fields":{"slug":"/mutations-variables","id":"8686a9a2-b50e-58d9-9a02-54211d3e389f","title":"Mutations & Query variables"}}},"83c70d71-d009-5737-b3d0-4a18e8ad99aa":{"slug":"/realtime-feed","title":"Realtime Feed","description":"You will learn how to make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people.","node":{"id":"83c70d71-d009-5737-b3d0-4a18e8ad99aa","children":[],"parent":"17eddc12-02f0-598f-af11-32b89f0e26ff","internal":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Realtime Feed\"\nmetaTitle: \"Realtime Public Todo Feed | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"You will learn how to make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people.\"\n---\n\nIn this section, you will:\n\n- Make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people\n- Complete the functionality for the rest of the app","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bd5e55845700c1f85fcfa302f67d0cda","counter":86,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Realtime Feed","metaTitle":"Realtime Public Todo Feed | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"You will learn how to make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Realtime Feed\"\nmetaTitle: \"Realtime Public Todo Feed | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"You will learn how to make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people.\"\n---\n\nIn this section, you will:\n\n- Make a realtime feed that captures public todos added by other people\n- Complete the functionality for the rest of the app","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/matsuzakiyoshinori/go/src/github.com/yellow-high5/naked_doc/content/realtime-feed.md","fields":{"slug":"/realtime-feed","id":"83c70d71-d009-5737-b3d0-4a18e8ad99aa","title":"Realtime Feed"}}},"86a9f358-3473-5016-b567-e2f3ec6db802":{"slug":"/setup","title":"Tutorial & boilerplate setup","description":"The GraphQL backend is already ready.

We still have one functionality left. When a new task arrives on the public feed and when the user clicks on the New tasks section, we should make a query to re-fetch the todos that are not present on our current public feed.\n\nUpdate `loadNew()` method with the following code\n\n```javascript\n  const loadNew = async () => {\n+   const GET_NEW_PUBLIC_TODOS = gql`\n+     query getNewPublicTodos ($latestVisibleId: Int!) {\n+       todos(where: { is_public: { _eq: true}, id: {_gt: $latestVisibleId}}, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {\n+         id\n+         title\n+         created_at\n+         user {\n+           name\n+         }\n+       }\n+     }\n+   `;\n+\n+   const { error, data } = await client.query({\n+      query: GET_NEW_PUBLIC_TODOS,\n+      variables: {\n+        latestVisibleId: state.todos.length ? state.todos[0].id : null\n+      }\n+    });\n \n+    if (data) {\n+      setState(prevState => {\n+        return {\n+          ...prevState,\n+          todos: [...data.todos, ...prevState.todos],\n+          newTodosCount: 0\n+        };\n+      });\n+      newestTodoId = data.todos[0].id;\n+    }\n+    if (error) {\n+      console.error(error);\n+      setState(prevState => {\n+        return { ...prevState, error: true };\n+      });\n+    } \n  }\n```","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ea0411230de8ada6c61da5b7ea55c78e","counter":94,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sync new todos","metaTitle":"Sync new todos in public feed | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"You will learn how to sync new todos added by other people in the public feed by fetching older and newer data using GraphQL Queries"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Sync new todos\"\nmetaTitle: \"Sync new todos in public feed | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"You will learn how to sync new todos added by other people in the public feed by fetching older and newer data using GraphQL Queries\"\n---\n\nOnce a new todo is entered in a public list, it needs to appear in the UI.

Using the `query` method directly and then process the response.\n2. New `useQuery` React hook with React. (Recommended)\n\n### Apollo useQuery React Hook\n\nThe recommended method is to use the `useQuery` React hook, where you will just pass your GraphQL query and `useQuery` React hook will fetch the data automatically.\n\nGreat! Now let's define the graphql query to be used:\n\nOpen `src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js` and add the following code:\n\n<GithubLink link=\"https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/blob/master/tutorials/frontend/react-apollo-hooks/app-final/src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js\" text=\"src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js\" />\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, Fragment } from \"react\";\n+ import gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nimport TodoItem from \"./TodoItem\";\nimport TodoFilters from \"./TodoFilters\";\n\n+ const GET_MY_TODOS = gql`\n+  query getMyTodos {\n+    todos(where: { is_public: { _eq: false} }, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {\n+      id\n+      title\n+      created_at\n+      is_completed\n+  }\n+ }`;\n```\n\nWe have now written the graphql query as a javascript constant using the `gql` parser function. This function is used to parse the plain string as a graphql query.\n\n## What does this query do?\n\nThe query fetches `todos` with a simple condition; `is_public` must be false. We sort the todos descending by its `created_at` time according to the schema. We specify which fields we need for the todos node.\n\nThe query is now ready, let's integrate it with our react code.\n\n```javascript\n\n+ import {useQuery} from '@apollo/react-hooks';\n\n```\n\n`useQuery` React hook is being imported from `@apollo/react-hooks`\n\n```javascript\n\nimport React, { Component, Fragment } from \"react\";\nimport {useQuery} from '@apollo/react-hooks'\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nimport TodoItem from \"./TodoItem\";\nimport TodoFilters from \"./TodoFilters\";\n\nconst GET_MY_TODOS = gql`\n  query getMyTodos {\n    todos(where: { is_public: { _eq: false} }, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {\n      id\n      title\n      created_at\n      is_completed\n  }\n}`;\n\nconst TodoPrivateList = props => {\n  ...\n}\n\n+ const TodoPrivateListQuery = () => {\n+   const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_MY_TODOS);\n+\n+   if (loading) {\n+     return <div>Loading...</div>;\n+   }\n+   if (error) {\n+     console.error(error);\n+     return <div>Error!</div>;\n+   }\n+   return <TodoPrivateList todos={data.todos} />;\n+ };\n\nexport default TodoPrivateList;\n```\n\nRemember that we wrapped our App component with `<ApolloProvider>` and passed `client` as a prop. `useQuery` React hook is using the same client.\n\nWe are importing the `useQuery` React hook from `@apollo/react-hooks` and the graphql query we defined above to fetch the todo data.\n\nLet's remove the mock `todos` data which was used to populate sample data.\n\n```javascript\n\nconst TodoPrivateList = props => {\n  const [state, setState] = useState({\n    filter: \"all\",\n    clearInProgress: false,\n-    todos: [\n-      {\n-        id: \"1\",\n-        title: \"This is private todo 1\",\n-        is_completed: true,\n-        is_public: false\n-      },\n-      {\n-        id: \"2\",\n-        title: \"This is private todo 2\",\n-        is_completed: false,\n-        is_public: false\n-      }\n-    ]\n  });\n\n  const filterResults = filter => {\n    setState({\n      ...state,\n      filter: filter\n    });\n  };\n\n  const clearCompleted = () => {};\n\n-    let filteredTodos = state.todos;\n+    const {todos} = props;\n+\n+    let filteredTodos = todos;\n    if (state.filter === \"active\") {\n-     filteredTodos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.is_completed !== true);\n+     filteredTodos = todos.filter(todo => todo.is_completed !== true);\n    } else if (state.filter === \"completed\") {\n-     filteredTodos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.is_completed === true);\n+     filteredTodos = todos.filter(todo => todo.is_completed === true);\n    }\n\n    const todoList = [];\n    filteredTodos.forEach((todo, index) => {\n      todoList.push(<TodoItem key={index} index={index} todo={todo} />);\n    });\n\n    return (\n      ...\n    );\n\n};\n\n```\n\nFinally, update the exports.\n\n```javascript\n- export default TodoPrivateList;\n+ export default TodoPrivateListQuery;\n+ export {GET_MY_TODOS};\n```\n\nWoot! You have written your first GraphQL integration with React. Easy isn't it?\n\n## How does this work?\n\nWhen you use the `useQuery` React hook, Apollo returns the data along with other properties. Most important ones are:\n\n`loading`: A boolean that indicates whether the request is in flight. If loading is true, then the request hasn't finished. Typically this information can be used to display a loading spinner.\n\n`error`: A runtime error with graphQLErrors and networkError properties. Contains information about what went wrong with your query.\n\n`data`: An object containing the result of your GraphQL query. This will contain our actual data from the server. In our case, it will be the todo data.\n\nYou can read more about other properties that result object contains [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/queries/#result)\n\nUsing the `data` property, we are parsing the results from the server. In our query, `data` property has an array `todos` which can be mapped over to render each `TodoItem`.\n\nIf you noted, there has been some client side filtering to the todos that are displayed.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6fd5891a2b6b358512c7bec6d6581fc6","counter":96,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"useQuery hook","metaTitle":"Apollo useQuery React hook | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"We will use the Apollo Client useQuery React hook from @apollo/react-hooks to make GraphQL queries"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: 'useQuery hook'\nmetaTitle: 'Apollo useQuery React hook | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial'\nmetaDescription: 'We will use the Apollo Client useQuery React hook from @apollo/react-hooks to make GraphQL queries'\n---\n\nimport GithubLink from \"../../src/components/docParts/GithubLink.tsx\";\n\nIn this section, we will implement GraphQL Queries and integrate with the react UI.\nWith Apollo Client, you can send queries in 2 different ways.\n\n1. Using the `query` method directly and then process the response.\n2. New `useQuery` React hook with React. (Recommended)\n\n### Apollo useQuery React Hook\n\nThe recommended method is to use the `useQuery` React hook, where you will just pass your GraphQL query and `useQuery` React hook will fetch the data automatically.\n\nGreat! Now let's define the graphql query to be used:\n\nOpen `src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js` and add the following code:\n\n<GithubLink link=\"https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/blob/master/tutorials/frontend/react-apollo-hooks/app-final/src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js\" text=\"src/components/Todo/TodoPrivateList.js\" />\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, Fragment } from \"react\";\n+ import gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nimport TodoItem from \"./TodoItem\";\nimport TodoFilters from \"./TodoFilters\";\n\n+ const GET_MY_TODOS = gql`\n+  query getMyTodos {\n+    todos(where: { is_public: { _eq: false} }, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {\n+      id\n+      title\n+      created_at\n+      is_completed\n+  }\n+ }`;\n```\n\nWe have now written the graphql query as a javascript constant using the `gql` parser function. This function is used to parse the plain string as a graphql query.\n\n## What does this query do?\n\nThe query fetches `todos` with a simple condition; `is_public` must be false. We sort the todos descending by its `created_at` time according to the schema.

Open `src/components/Todo/TodoInput.js` and add the following code below the other imports:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useMutation } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\n```\n\nWe are importing the `useMutation` React hook from `@apollo/react-hooks` and the graphql query we defined above to fetch the todo data.\n\nNow, we will use the `useMutation` React hook passing our graphql mutation constant that we imported. Add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst TodoInput = ({isPublic=false}) => {\n  \n+ const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);\n\nreturn (\n  ...\n)\n\n};\n```\n\nIn the `useMutation` React hook defined above, the first argument of the result tuple is the mutate function; (addTodo) in this case. Read more about the mutate function [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations/#result)\n\nThe mutate function optionally takes variables, optimisticResponse, refetchQueries, and update; You are going to make use of the `update` function later.\n\nWe need to handle the change event so that when the user types something on the input box, we update the state.\n\nWe are going to make use of `useState` hook for this.\n\n```javascript\n- import React from 'react';\n+ import React, {useState} from 'react';\n```\n\nWe will initialise the state and add an `onChange` handler to update the state.\n\n```javascript\nconst TodoInput = ({isPublic = false}) => {\n+  let input;\n\n+  const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState('');\n\n   const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);\n \n   return (\n           <form className=\"formInput\" onSubmit={(e) => {\n             e.preventDefault();\n           }}>\n             <input\n               className=\"input\"\n               placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\"\n+              value={todoInput}\n+              onChange={e => (setTodoInput(e.target.value))}\n+              ref={n => (input = n)}\n             />\n             <i className=\"inputMarker fa fa-angle-right\" />\n           </form>\n         );\n};\n```\n\nNow let's handle the form submit to invoke the mutation.\n\n```javascript\n      return (\n        <form className=\"formInput\" onSubmit={(e) => {\n          e.preventDefault();\n+         addTodo({variables: {todo: todoInput, isPublic }});\n        }}>\n          <input\n            className=\"input\"\n            placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\"\n            value={todoInput}\n            onChange={e => (setTodoInput(e.target.value))}\n            ref={n => (input = n)}\n          />\n          <i className=\"inputMarker fa fa-angle-right\" />\n        </form>\n      );\n```\n\nWe are passing the mutate function (`addTodo`) to our form submit handler.\nThe mutate function's first argument would be the mutation query's options, such as variables etc. We are now passing the variables required for the mutation. \n\nThe mutation has been integrated and the new todos will be inserted into the database. But the UI doesn't know that a new todo has been added. We need a way to tell Apollo Client to update the query for the list of todos.\n\n### Apollo React Mutation Update\nThe `update` function comes in handy to update the cache for this mutation. It comes with utility functions such as `readQuery` and `writeQuery` that helps in reading from and writing to the cache.\n\nLet's implement `update` for the above mutation.\n\nWe pass the update function as an option to `useMutation`.\n\n```javascript\n-    const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);\n+    const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {update: updateCache});\n```\n\nWe need to fetch the current list of todos from the cache. So let's import the query that we used in the previous steps.\n\n```javascript\nimport {GET_MY_TODOS} from './TodoPrivateList';\n```\n\nLet's define the updateCache function to read and write to cache.\n\n```javascript\nconst TodoInput = ({isPublic = false}) => {\n  let input;\n\n  const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState('');\n  \n+  const updateCache = (cache, {data}) => {\n+    // If this is for the public feed, do nothing\n+    if (isPublic) {\n+      return null;\n+    }\n+\n+    // Fetch the todos from the cache\n+    const existingTodos = cache.readQuery({\n+      query: GET_MY_TODOS\n+    });\n+\n+    // Add the new todo to the cache\n+    const newTodo = data.insert_todos.returning[0];\n+    cache.writeQuery({\n+      query: GET_MY_TODOS,\n+      data: {todos: [newTodo, ...existingTodos.todos]}\n+    });\n+  };\n\n  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {update: updateCache});\n  \n   return (\n    ...\n   );\n};\n```\n\nLet's dissect what's happening in this code snippet.\n\nOur goals were simple:\n\n- Make a mutation to insert the new todo in the database.\n- Once the mutation is done, we need to update the cache to update the UI.\n\nThe update function is used to update the cache after a mutation occurs.\nIt receives the result of the mutation (data) and the current cache (store) as arguments. You will then use these arguments to manage your cache so that the UI will be up to date.\n\n### readQuery and writeQuery\n\ncache.readQuery\n---------------\n\nUnlike `client.query`, readQuery will never make a request to your GraphQL server. It will always read from the cache. So we make a read request to the cache to get the current list of todos.\n\ncache.writeQuery\n----------------\n\nWe have already done the mutation to the graphql server using the mutate function. Our goal was to update the UI. This is where writeQuery comes to the rescue. writeQuery will allow you to change data in your local cache, but it is important to remember that they will not change any data on your server (exactly what we need).\n\n  Any subscriber to the Apollo Client store will instantly see this update and render new UI accordingly.\n\nWe concatenate our new todo from our mutation with the list of existing todos and write the query back to the cache with cache.writeQuery\n\nNow, the TodoPrivateList component using the `useQuery` React hook will get the updated todo list as it is automatically subscribed to the store.\n\nGreat! That was actually easy :)\n\nLet's wrap this by adding a function to clear the input value once the mutation is successful.\n\n```javascript\n-  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {update: updateCache});\n+  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {\n+    update: updateCache,\n+    onCompleted: resetInput\n+  });\n```\n\nWe pass a function called `resetInput` to the `onCompleted` option which will be called once the mutation is completed. The function definition looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst TodoInput = ({isPublic = false}) => {\n  let input;\n\n  const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState('');\n\n  const updateCache = (cache, {data}) => {\n    ...\n  };\n\n+  const resetInput = () => {\n+    setTodoInput('');\n+  };\n\n  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {\n    update: updateCache,\n    onCompleted: resetInput\n  });\n\n  return (\n    ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"231bd62bc184ccb9ec199998cffaaaba","counter":107,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"useMutation Hook, Update Cache","metaTitle":"Apollo useMutation React hook | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"We will use the Apollo Client useMutation from @apollo/react-hooks in React app as an example to insert new data and update cache locally using readQuery and writeQuery."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"useMutation Hook, Update Cache\"\nmetaTitle: \"Apollo useMutation React hook | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"We will use the Apollo Client useMutation from @apollo/react-hooks in React app as an example to insert new data and update cache locally using readQuery and writeQuery.\"\n---\n\n### Apollo useMutation React hook\nNow let's do the integration part.

Note that the GraphQL query is not really JSON; it looks like the shape of the\n   JSON you *want*. So when we make a 'POST' request to send our GraphQL query to\n   the server, it is sent as a \"string\" by the client.\n2. The server gets the JSON object and extracts the query string. As per the\n   GraphQL syntax and the graph data model (GraphQL schema), the server processes\n   and validates the GraphQL query.\n3. Just like a typical API server, the GraphQL API server then makes calls to a\n   database or other services to fetch the data that the client requested.\n4. The server then takes the data and returns it to the client in a JSON object.\n\n### Example GraphQL client setup:\n\nIn your day to day work, you don't actually need to worry about the underlying\nHTTP requests & responses.\n\nJust like when you work with a REST API and use a HTTP\nclient to reduce the boilerplate in making API calls and handling responses, you\ncan choose a GraphQL client to make writing GraphQL queries, sending them and\nhandling responses much easier.\n\nIn fact, the mechanism of how you send the GraphQL query and accept the GraphQL\nresponse has become standard. This makes working with GraphQL very easy on the\nclient.\n\nHere's what a typical GraphQL client setup and making a query would look like:\n\n```javascript\n\n// Setup a GraphQL client to use the endpoint\n\nconst client = new client(\"https://myapi.com/graphql\");\n\n\n// Now, send your query as a string (Note that ` is used to create a multi-line\n// string in javascript).\n\nclient.query(`\n  query {\n    user {\n      id\n      name\n    }\n  }`);\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"12b62b4beb1d842f5c7808405efc678f","counter":108,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"default-site-plugin","id":"default-site-plugin","title":"default-site-plugin"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Architecture","metaTitle":"GraphQL Architecture | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial","metaDescription":"Learn about the architecture of GraphQL, GraphQL over HTTP, the client server model with an example of http request"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Architecture\"\nmetaTitle: \"GraphQL Architecture | GraphQL React Apollo Hooks Tutorial\"\nmetaDescription: \"Learn about the architecture of GraphQL, GraphQL over HTTP, the client server model with an example of http request\"\n---\n\nBefore going further in understanding GraphQL, it's useful to get a sense of how\nGraphQL is actually used in an HTTP client (typically a web/mobile app).\n\n## GraphQL over HTTP\nCheck out the diagram below, to get a sense of how GraphQL is typically used in\nyour stack:\n\n![GraphQL over HTTP](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/graphql-on-http.png)\n\n### GraphQL client-server flow:\n\n1.

The most common\nway to browse a GraphQL API is to use GraphiQL. GraphiQL is a tool\nbuilt by Facebook, (pronounced \"graphical\") that makes it easy to explore\nany GraphQL API.\n\nWhen you connect GraphiQL to a GraphQL endpoint, it\nqueries the server for its GraphQL schema and gives you a UI to browse\nand test queries, and that powers its amazing autocomplete!\n\n![GraphiQL demo](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/graphiql.gif)\n\nTools like GraphiQL make GraphQL APIs really easy\nto use and integrate APIs in your app without requiring\nexternal documentation tools.\n\nYou can access the GraphiQL for this realtime todo app tutorial here:\n[hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql)\n\nWhen you work with a GraphQL API in a project you will almost always\nuse a tool like GraphiQL to explore and test your GraphQL queries.\n\n## Basic GraphQL query\n\n1. Open GraphiQL at: [hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql). \n   You'll have to login to get an auth token to query the API. In a real-world scenario\n   your GraphQL APIs will be protected.\n2. You'll see a URL, and headers that contain the auth\n   token that will be sent along with your GraphQL query.\n3. Now, paste this GraphQL query in the GraphiQL window\n\n```graphql\n query {\n   users {\n     name\n   }\n }\n```\n\n4. Hit `ctrl + enter` or `cmd + enter` (mac) or click on the ▶️ icon to run the GraphQL query\n5. On the right, you should see a list of users by their names that are in the system!\n\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\nRecall that there is no magic here! The hosted GraphiQL app is sending a GraphQL query string\nto the server at the given endpoint with the HTTP headers. The server then sends the response\nthat you see on the right hand side.\n\n## Fetching \"graphs\"\n\nOur todo app has users, todos and information about users that are currently online.\nThis is what our API \"schema\" looks like:\n\n![Schema](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-react/schema.png)\n\nAs you can see, it is a \"graph\" like schema where all the 3 models are linked to each other.\n\nLet's try making queries that fetch different slices of our data from the overall \"graph\".\n\n### Fetch users and their todos\n\nThis GraphQL query will fetch all the users and their publicly visible todos:\n\n```graphql\n query {\n   users {\n     name\n     todos {\n       title\n     }\n   }\n }\n```\n\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\n\n### Fetch online users and their profile information\n\nThis GraphQL query will fetch all the currently online users\nand their profile information (which is just their name for now):\n\n```graphql\n query {\n   online_users {\n     last_seen\n     user {\n       name\n     }\n   }\n }\n```\n\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\n\n## Adding parameters (arguments) to GraphQL queries\n\nIn most API calls, you usually use parameters. For example, to specify what data you're fetching.\nIf you're familiar with making `GET` calls, you would have used a query parameter. For example,\nto fetch only 10 todos you might have made this API call: `GET /api/todos?limit=10`.\n\nThe GraphQL query analog of this is *arguments* that you can attach to a \"field\".\n\n### Basic argument: Fetch 10 todos\n\nThis GraphQL query will fetch 10 todos and not all of them.\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  todos(limit: 10) {\n    id\n    title\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\nThe most important bit to check here is `limit: 10`. GraphQL servers will provide a list of\narguments that can be used in `()` next to specific fields. In our case, we are using\nHasura for creating the GraphQL backend which provides filter, sort and pagination arguments.\nThe GraphQL server or API that you use, might provide a different set of arguments that can be used.\n\n### Multiple arguments on multiple fields: Fetch 1 user and 5 most recent todos for each user\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  users (limit: 1) {\n    id\n    name\n    todos(order_by: {created_at: desc}, limit: 5) {\n      id\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we are passing arguments to different fields. This GraphQL query reads as:\n> Fetch users (with limit 1), and their todos (ordered by descending creation time, and limited to 5).\n\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\n<a name=\"query-variables\"></a>\n\n## GraphQL variables: Passing arguments to your queries dynamically\n\nThis is great, but we still have a problem. If we want to create a query\nwhere we are fetching data with arguments that are provided dynamically, we'd have to \ncreate the entire query string again.\n\nThis is what we don't want to do:\n\n```javascript\nvar limit = getMaxTodosFromUserInput();\nvar query = \"query { todos (limit: \" + limit.toString() + \") {id title} }\";\n```\n\nThankfully, we don't ever have to do this! GraphQL variables are extra variables\nthat you can send in a query so that the \"arguments\" can be provided dynamically!\n\n## Fetch $limit number of todos\n\nThis is what our GraphQL query would look like:\n```graphql\nquery ($limit: Int!) {\n  todos(limit: $limit) {\n    id\n    title\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the query above, we send a variables object:\n```json\n{\n   \"limit\": 10\n}\n```\n\nNow instead of sending just the query to the GraphQL server, from our client\nwe'll send both the query and the variables. The GraphQL server will use the\nvariable in the right place in the query automatically for us!\n\nLet's try this out in GraphiQL:\n1. Head to GraphiQL\n2. Write out this query\n3.

We\nwould rarely, if ever, have a \"hardcoded\" mutation in our app. This is because\nthe arguments of what data to capture, how to modify or delete something is usually\ndependent on some user action.\n\nNow that we know how to parameterise using query variables, let's use that:\n\n```graphql\n# The parameterised GraphQL mutation\nmutation($todo: todos_insert_input!){\n  insert_todos(objects: [$todo]) {\n    returning {\n      id\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n# As a query variable\n{\n  \"todo\": {\n    \"title\": \"A new dynamic todo\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!-- [//]: # TODO: -->\n<b><a href=\"https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql\" target=\"_blank\">Try it out in GraphiQL</a></b>\n\nWe'll explore more mutations to update or delete data a little later.\nThis is a good start to grokking mutations!\n\n## Summary\n\n- You can make basic GraphQL mutations\n- You can pass dynamic arguments/data to mutations with query variables\n\nNext, let's look at GraphQL subscriptions\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/matsuzakiyoshinori/go/src/github.com/yellow-high5/naked_doc/content/intro-to-graphql/3-writing-data-mutations.md","fields":{"slug":"/intro-to-graphql/3-writing-data-mutations","id":"22f2d6a2-a037-5d38-8b6a-9d73eae57535","title":"Writing data - Mutations"}}},"3c31e907-f818-5f3f-83a9-df1a86d760c9":{"slug":"/intro-to-graphql/4-watching-data-subscriptions","title":"Watching data - Subscriptions","description":"Try out GraphQL Subscription using GraphiQL.
